BEAKL10

This version uses as base a qwerty setup on the LY092-SN
copies of
profile\qwerty\qwertyLeft.bin
profile\qwerty\qwertyRightShifted.bin
(right hand is 'qwertyShifted' so that the home row is where we want it)

with BEAKL10 specific mods for the alt/shift etc keys
and personal adjustments (thumbs)

**Note: the LY092-SN des NOT output Alt_R, so we use Numpad5 as altGr instead !
