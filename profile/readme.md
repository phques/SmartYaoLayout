Working on setting up a Koolertron (SmartYao) keyboard.  
Planning to use non traditional layouts, probably one of the BEAKL versions.  
Possibly also a personally modified MTGAP french layout.  
As it seems that I will not be able to program the 3-4 layers directly in the hardware, I plan on using AutoHotkey  with some scripts I wrote ('pqAhkLayouts' project) to handle the mapping. I also use an 'extend' / edit layer, so I need 5 layers  
 - main 
 - shifted 
 - punctuation (usually on altGr)
 - numpad
 - extend / edit
