same as qwertyRef,
but Enter <=> Shift swapped on thumbs
to 
Shift on left     Enter on right

this is used for layouts that use shift-altGr,
sice altGr is on the right, right besides shift,
having shift on the other side makes it a bit easier

Also this is the 
'compact' version:

with Thumbs home pos close to the center (avoid constant stretch / tension)
